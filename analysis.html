            The provided dataset contains information about the number of fast track courts in each state/union territory of India for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022.
    <br>
    
            A fast track court is a special court established to deal with cases that require expedited resolution, typically cases related to serious crimes against women and children or cases that have been pending for a long time.
            <br>
            <br>
            Based on the dataset, we can make the following observations regarding the number of fast track courts in India:
    <br>
    <br>
           1. The total number of fast track courts in India in 2020, 2021, and 2022 was 467, 546, and 652, respectively. This indicates that the number of fast track courts in India has been increasing steadily over the years, which is a positive development.
    <br>
   2.  The state/union territory with the highest number of fast track courts in all three years was Uttar Pradesh, with 218 fast track courts. This is not surprising, given that Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in India and has a high incidence of crimes against women and children.
    <br>
   3.  Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Goa, Jammu and Kashmir, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Tripura had the same number of fast track courts in all three years, indicating that the number of fast track courts in these states/union territories has not changed over time.
    <br>
4.  Some states/union territories have seen a significant increase in the number of fast track courts over the years. For example, Chandigarh had only one fast track court in 2020, but this number increased to 48 in 2022. Similarly, Kerala had 23 fast track courts in 2020, but this number increased to 52 in 2022.
    <br>
    5. Some states/union territories had no fast track courts in certain years. For example, Delhi had no fast track courts in 2020 but had 16 in 2021 and 2022. Similarly, Goa had no fast track courts in 2020 and 2021 but had one in 2022.
    <br>
 
    </p>
    
    <p>
<br>
        Top 5 states/union territories with highest percentage increase:
        <br>
        Chandigarh - The number of fast track courts increased by a whopping 4700% from 2021 to 2022.
        <br>
        Punjab - The number of fast track courts increased by 300% from 2020 to 2021.
        <br>
        Andhra Pradesh - The number of fast track courts increased by 40% from 2021 to 2022, following a 25% increase from 2020 to 2021.
        <br>
        Kerala - The number of fast track courts increased by 85.71% from 2021 to 2022, following a 21.74% increase from 2020 to 2021.
        <br>
        Karnataka - The number of fast track courts increased by 66.67% from 2021 to 2022, following a 28.57% increase from 2020 to 2021.
        <br>
        <br>
        Bottom 5 states/union territories with no increase or decrease:
<br>
Bihar - The number of fast track courts remained the same from 2020 to 2022.
<br>
Chhattisgarh - The number of fast track courts remained the same from 2020 to 2022.
<br>
Delhi - There were no fast track courts in Delhi in 2020, and the number increased to 16 in 2021, but remained the same in 2022.
<br>
Gujarat - The number of fast track courts remained the same from 2020 to 2022.
<br>
Rajasthan - The number of fast track courts remained the same from 2020 to 2022.
<br>
<br>
Overall, it's encouraging to see that some states/union territories have significantly increased the number of fast track courts, which can help speed up the resolution of pending cases and improve access to justice. However, there are still many states/union territories where the number of fast track courts remains the same, which highlights the need for continued efforts to improve the efficiency of the justice system.
